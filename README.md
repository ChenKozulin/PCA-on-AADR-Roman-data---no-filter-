# PCA-on-AADR-Roman-data---no-filter-
initial PCA on roman data
The scripts read four files form the AADR (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FFIDCW):
an .anno, .ind, .geno and .snp. One of the issues is finding thew right way to read the binary format of the .geno file. 
Next the data is filtered according to the .anno file and PCA is plotted
